In this,
programming using object & classes --OOPs.... how,what & why.
way of writing code approach 

@Classes & objects;
objects- entities in yhe real world.
classes- group of these entities. (usually a group/collection of entities inhibiting similar properties

Class basically serves as a blueprint or template for creating entities. 
It has its own attributes(properties) as well as functions(behaviour). 
It should have same name as of the file name. Conventionally, Class name is of form of: PascalCase
Classes except public class should be written after public class only so as to ensure no difficulty/problem in creating object.
A program on run first sees public class, main function (by convention, main function has to be public,static (access modifiers), it is not necessary always to write access modifiers too.)
